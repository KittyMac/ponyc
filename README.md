# Rocco's Pony Fork

Welcome to my fork of Pony!  Pony is pretty amazing.

My fork has several major additions you might find intersting.  
[Check out the Divergence documentation for full list of differences.](https://github.com/KittyMac/ponyc/blob/roc_master/DIVERGENCE.md).

* **Built-in code transpiler**  
Generate Pony code automatically from C headers, Json Schema, and text-based resources.  
* **Additional error handling**  
Send an int-based error code wihen you throw an error, or get the source code location of any error you throw.  
* **Pony runtime analysis tools**  
Writing Pony code which under performs due to not understanding the Pony runtime is shockingly easy. With the --ponyanalysis option turned on you will be told when your application crosses some of the hidden barriers (and provides mechanisms for how to avoid them)!
* **Actor execution on "main thread" only**  
If you need to use Pony with OpenGL or other UI frameworks which rely on code executing on the "main thread" now you can.
* **Cross-compile to iOS**  
Yes, you can run Pony on iOS.  You're welcome.


That being said, there are reasons not to use this fork:

* **Active pace of development and experimentation**  
As of this writing, development is active on this fork and breaking changes can happen daily.
* **Support hierarchy is Mac > Linux > Windows**  
My development platform of choice is Mac OS. As such, if you are building on Linux or Windows your mileage may vary.
